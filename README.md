Iris Dataset Streamlit App

This project is an interactive web application built with Streamlit to explore and visualize the famous Iris dataset.
The Iris dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in machine learning and statistics, containing measurements of sepal and petal length/width for three flower species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

🚀 Features

📊 Data Exploration – View the raw Iris dataset in an interactive table.

📈 Visualization – Generate customizable plots (scatter, histogram, pairplots, etc.) for better understanding of features.

🤖 Machine Learning Model – Train and test simple ML models (like Logistic Regression, KNN, or Decision Tree) directly in the app.

🔮 Prediction – Input custom values of sepal & petal measurements and predict the Iris species.
